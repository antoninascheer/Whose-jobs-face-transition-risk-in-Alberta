# Whose-jobs-face-transition-risk-in-Alberta
This repository presents the code used to undertake the econometric analysis presented in the article "Whose jobs face transition risk in Alberta? Understanding sectoral employment precarity in an oil-rich Canadian province" published in Climate Policy (DOI: 10.1080/14693062.2022.2086843). Included in this folder is code to enable data preparation, VECM analysis, ARDL analysis, and associated functions. 
(1) Data preparation code, which downloads relevant datasets from public online sources and saves it in folders that can be prepared by the code user. 
(2) Code and associated functions for the vector error correction model, which we use to evaluate the effect of oil price changes on province-wide employment levels. 
(3) Code and associated functions for the autoregressive distributed lag models, which we use to evaluate the effect of oil price changes on employment levels in several seperate economic sectors.
(4) Code to view output table for ARDL results
